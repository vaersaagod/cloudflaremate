## Description

CloudflareMate makes life a little bit easier when using Cloudflare to statically cache Craft CMS sites, by  

1. ...making sure that requests are served with proper Cache-Control headers 
2. ...purging Cloudfare caches automatically when elements are created, saved, moved, deleted, etc.
3. ...exposing some nifty buttons in the CP for purging the edge cache manually

## Requirements

This plugin requires Craft CMS 4.7.0 or later, and PHP 8.1 or later.
